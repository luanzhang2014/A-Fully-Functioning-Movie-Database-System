# A-Fully-Functioning-Movie-Database-System
- Implemented in HTML, CSS and PHP
- Created a fully functioning movie database system accessed by users exclusively through a Web interface
- The system had input pages that let users add review about movies into the database, browsing pages that showed
information of movies, directors and actors, and search pages that let users search information through a multi-word search interface
